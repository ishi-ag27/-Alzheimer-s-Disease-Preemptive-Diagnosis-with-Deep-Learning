# Alzheimer's-Disease : Preemptive Diagnosis with Deep-Learning

This repository features a deep learning-based classification system for detecting and categorizing Alzheimer's disease into four stages: Non-dementia, Mild dementia, Very mild dementia, and Moderate dementia.

## Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive illness causing cognitive decline. Early detection is vital for managing symptoms. This project uses deep learning methods to classify the stages of Alzheimer's disease effectively.

## Models

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Custom CNN architecture.
- **EfficientNetB2:** Pre-trained model optimized for efficiency.
- **ResNet50:** Pre-trained model known for robust performance.


## Performance

- **ResNet50:** 98% accuracy
- **EfficientNetB2:** 99% accuracy
- **Custom CNN:** 91% accuracy

## Dataset

The dataset used is **AugmentedAlzheimerDataset** from Kaggle. You can access it via the following link: [AugmentedAlzheimerDataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uraninjo/augmented-alzheimer-mri-dataset).

The data consists of MRI images. The data has four classes of images both in training as well as a testing set:

Mild Demented
Moderate Demented
Non Demented
Very Mild Demented

The data contains two folders. One of them is augmented ones and the other one is originals.
Originals could be used for validation or test datasetâ€¦
