# Alzheimer's-Disease : Preemptive Diagnosis with Deep-Learning

This repository features a deep learning-based classification system for detecting and categorizing Alzheimer's disease into four stages: Non-dementia, Mild dementia, Very mild dementia, and Moderate dementia.

## Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive illness causing cognitive decline. Early detection is vital for managing symptoms. This project uses deep learning methods to classify the stages of Alzheimer's disease effectively.

## Models

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Custom CNN architecture.
- **EfficientNetB2:** Pre-trained model optimized for efficiency.
- **ResNet50:** Pre-trained model known for robust performance.


## Performance

- **ResNet50:** 98% accuracy
- **EfficientNetB2:** 99% accuracy
- **Custom CNN:** 91% accuracy

## Dataset

The dataset used is **AugmentedAlzheimerDataset** from Kaggle. You can access it via the following link: [AugmentedAlzheimerDataset](
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images). 

The data consists of MRI images. The data has four classes of images both in training as well as a testing set:

Mild Demented
Moderate Demented
Non Demented
Very Mild Demented
