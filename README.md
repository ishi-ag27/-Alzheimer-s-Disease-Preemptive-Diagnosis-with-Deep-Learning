# Alzheimer's-Disease : Preemptive Diagnosis with Deep-Learning

This repository features a deep learning-based classification system for detecting and categorizing Alzheimer's disease into four stages: Non-dementia, Mild dementia, Very mild dementia, and Moderate dementia.

## Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive illness causing cognitive decline. Early detection is vital for managing symptoms. This project uses deep learning methods to classify the stages of Alzheimer's disease effectively.

## Models

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Custom CNN architecture.
- **EfficientNetB2:** Pre-trained model optimized for efficiency.
- **ResNet50:** Pre-trained model known for robust performance.

The models were trained on a Kaggle dataset with 6400 images.

## Performance

- **ResNet50:** 98% accuracy
- **EfficientNetB2:** 99% accuracy
- **Custom CNN:** 91% accuracy

## Dataset

The dataset used is **AugmentedAlzheimerDataset** from Kaggle. You can access it via the following link: [AugmentedAlzheimerDataset](
